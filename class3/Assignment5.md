#### For my final project, I plan to analyze what region of the country (city or state) are black women reported to die the most from preganacy related deaths in 2019. 

### According to an American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists study, it's reported that black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications compared to white women. And shockingly, more than a third of these pregnancy-related deaths were caused by mistreatment or misdiagnosis of cardiovascular conditions, according a CDC report.

### Due to this clear data-driven disparity from  this specific demographic of people, this topic is timely, significant, and relevant to shed light on. I personally haven't seen much stories that discuss this speciic topic, so I know the readers of my story will find my story nuanced in conversation. My news hook will tie into answering questions that my readers never thought to ask or haven't been sufficiently addressed.

### The questions I plan to address will be: what region of the country produced the most pregancy related death for black women in 2019, what socio-economic factors caused these deaths in this region, and what preventative measures took place in this region to reduce this frequency. 

### Some data sources I plan to use are 2019 studies and reports from the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

### The elements of the data that will be good candiates to visualize will be the amount black women die from preganancy related complication the most in a region and the reasons for these death in the region.
